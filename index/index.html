				<div>This site is the latest of many attempts to cohesively record the materials I had developed during my last two semesters as a Communication Design student at Parsons School of Design.</div>

			<div>Is this project better off as an essay? Is this essay better off as a set of pictures and interactions? <span class="number">02</span> Who’s going to read all of this anyway? Notes on Verbalizing is my unsteady attempt at answering these questions, and figuring out why I asked them in the first place. Born out of a personal obsession with articulating research, it contends with the complexities of translating those articulations into a legible structure and a realistic practice.</div>
			<br>
			<div>The definitions of “verbalizing” represent this translation: turning a concept into words, or a noun into a verb. The term’s incomplete and uncertain state highlights how texts orbit between being form & content, and works orbit between being products & processes.</div>
			<br>
			<div>As the name suggests, this thesis is a collection of notes informed by assorted verbs (“querying”, “detailing”, “glitching”, etc.). Ranging from hypertext transcripts and map-like broadsheets, to narrated montages and ornamental borders, each verb employs a distinct format and visual language to examine and circulate its fragmented meanings. The fragments themselves are compiled from ongoing conversations with the texts and people around me.</div>
			<br>
			<div>At the risk of over-explaining — “verbalizing” is also defined as a tendency to excessively speak  — I hope to explore and embrace the inconstancy that characterizes the overlaps of design and articulation. The essay is never really finished and the project is never really polished, and I think that’s ok!</div>
