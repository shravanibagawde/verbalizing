			<p class="desc">Light Infrastructures, The Number 7, and Restarting</p>
			<p class="writing">A few months ago, I had the chance to design a calendar for the new year with my current studio. It was a letter-pressed, spiral-bound booklet, with each page representing seven days. The format was brought back by popular demand from a small but enthusiastic crowd of supporters.</p>
			<p class="writing">I think I have spent at least a quarter of my life organizing time (I’m counting this sentence in that estimate as well). In that period, I have grown fond of certain units of measurement over others. Seconds, hours, and minutes are most prominent while preheating the oven, while counting down the hours left in the workday, or while waiting for the digital clock to reach a multiple of 10 — that’s when I’ll put my phone down, I swear.</p>
			<p class="writing">Counting days is a bit too tedious. And at the age of 23, counting years feels too grandiose, as if I am trying to build something without the proper inventory to do so. Months are a bit better, and seasons are far more conducive with my memory.</p>
			<p class="writing">But nothing beats the good old week. It seems like the most I can chew on, within reasonable expectations of myself. It’s arbitrary, and generous. Seven days ago, my roommates and I were discussing our favorite numbers at a nearby happy hour. We all agreed that the number seven was The Most Handsome.</p>
			<p class="writing">On Sunday, Kiara texted me, i feel like i truly need more time for each day. I was tempted to ask her, have you thought about taking it week by week instead?</p> 
			<p class="writing">Next week, I’m trying something new. A 7-day schedule, made in an attempt to find more time for personal work, more time for rest, and more time to live. I have tried and failed, and tried and failed again, to maintain disciplinary regimens after finishing school and starting work. This routine might be another unsuccessful attempt, but this time I am keen on introducing an element of lightness: an ability to recognize frameworks, but not be burdened by them. I am reminded of a lecture by <a href="https://laurelsletter.substack.com/p/laurels-letter-fall-winter-2023?open=false#%C2%A7of-ultralight">Laurel Schwulst, and her concept of the ultra-light.</a>She spoke of a the kite as a model — “holding on to something, while still letting it float about”</p>
			<p class="writing">Two winters ago, I made a trip to Pune with my mother, and spent some time at my grandparents’ home. There, we found an old family ledger maintained by my grandfather from the years 1973 to 1989. The ledger came with its own printed timeframes, dividing each spread into 4 sections for 4 days. My grandfather opted to use a day’s worth of space for a full week’s worth of accounting, writing his own headers and ultimately maximizing the amount of pages offered by the book. This resourcefulness was passed down to my mother, who continues to make use of the free real estate in her out-dated planners as just another place to transcribe her current to-do lists. The scribbling of the everyday spills across the inscribed 7-column grids of their calendars.</p>
			<p class="writing">With this in mind, I look forward to the coming weeks and the gradual filling up of my own letter-pressed, spiral-bound calendar. </p>

			<p class="writing">Reflecting on the structure and narrative this essay (which has been both extremely fruitful and extremely frustrating) has now built up to reminded me of the <a href="http://www.kit.ntnu.no/sites/www.kit.ntnu.no/files/What%20is%20a%20Theorist%20by%20Irit%20Rogoff.pdf">Irit Rogoff's</a> idea of going from criticism to critique to criticality. Section ( 1 ) starts with "structure" itself, discussing the instability between form/content & medium/message relationships; Section ( 2 ) expands from the structure and looks out to the environment, turning the structure into an actor and a participant in infrastructure; Section ( 3 ) expands beyond that and critically looks back everything that has been built before it, and it's real world feasibility.</p><p>The number 3 keeps coming up in everything I do!</p><p>This also reminds me of Ramia Mazé's modes of criticality...which might bring an interesting dimension as well.</p>

			<p class="writing">FORGET WHAT I SAID. Or more appropriately, as per Heidegger and Derrida, I should strikethrough a few sentences and ideas from last week’s entry. After writing on the notion of perpetuity, I began thinking about the logistics (eh word) of setting out to create something that is perpetual. If perpetuity is a goal that I embark with, doesn’t this (nonetheless) contradict with my hopes of avoiding permanence? I think many of my thoughts were heading down the route of perpetuity being an unintended effect of a work (by way of circulation, by way of something being kept alive), and not necessarily an integral aspect of the work. </p>
			<p class="writing">Moreover, this led me towards realizing that the challenge of “perpetuity” does place me in a difficult technical position. <span class="grey">(I am not a good coder)</span></p>
			<p class="writing">Maybe this seem like a copout, but I think “incomplete’ is the better word. It signifies: my limitations as a facilitator in this project, the potential encountering of gaps and the invitation of external and ongoing contributions. It gestures towards a potential ending but not one that is clearly defined or visible. </p>
		</div>

			<div class="desc">12/26/2023</div>
			<p class="desc">On Being Perpetual:</p>
			<p class="writing">When I underline that my works/body of works strives to be perpetual, I intend for their perpetuity to not be through the “solid nature” of my work or any long-lasting monumental structure, but rather through the possibility of continued interactions. In this case, it is not the projects themselves that are perpetual, but rather their circulation through people and people’s interactions with them (Re: “Dispersion”).</p>
			<p class="writing">Thinking about a recently heard conversation on the arrogance of believing that a language is kept alive through people; rather that it is the language itself that keeps people alive. Maybe this is the antithesis to the literal idea that I underlined above, but I think it all relates back to humility: the notion of relinquishing a sort of control and allowing yourself to see how your surroundings keep you afloat and define you. THIS IS GETTING TOO THEORETICAL…</p>

			<p class="writing">From the get-go, my biggest conflict has been deliberating whether the topic(s) I want to research through my thesis even warrant “design interventions”. In other words, everything that I could imagine working on feels like it should just be an essay or a paper or something just written out. I think this year has been a bit of a break-through in realizing that maybe I have always been a writer first and a designer second <span class="grey">(Although I am extremely hesitant to assign myself either of those titles in any sort of credible capacity).</span></p> 
			<p>But considering I am graduating with a degree in design and that the act of making does still bring me some joy, I hope to funnel this feeling into something a bit less hindering. I could center the act of writing, the act of researching in my process. Instead of it being an initial step, could it be the primary focus? <span class="grey">(Reminds me of something Kath Burton, from the CFTH interviews said: “…a digital archive that documents the different outputs along a research process”)</span> In this way, design becomes less so an *intervention*  and more-so an interpretation? It becomes a way of understanding as opposed to a container?</p>

			<p>Some thing I have to keep telling myself is that making itself is a kind of research. Even outside the more typical formal explorations and experiments that approach allows, making itself is conducive to other kinds of research.</p>

			<p>(  2  ) From Andrew: "Try switching the order of drafting, writing, editing and designing" (Using a pre-determined format and then finding content to match it)</p>
			<p class="writing">(  3  ) On Pamphlets & Margins:  Make the border as large and attention-seeking as possible (encroachment, erosion); Add more media (can the multimedia component of the pamphlets can be embeded into the peripheries themselves)</p>

			<p class="writing">Small group feedback:</p>
			<p class="writing">(  1  ) Very effective to show people’s interpretations of doubts/defaults </p>
			<p class="writing">(  2  ) Consider the hierarchy of presentation (what are you showing first? how can you ease people into this topic?)</p>
			<p class="writing">(  3  ) Perhaps establishing a similar frame work as with SMS research (1. Definitional and historical framework; 2. Getting into one side of the relationship; 4. Getting into the other side of the relationship; 5. Exploring the integrated relationship) </p>

			<p class="writing">Potentially, the works could embody different lenses and perspectives through which to explore the relationship between doubts or defaults (or scarily, something else that may arise as a better topic of focus).</p>
			<p class="writing">Exploring temporality…releasing information over time</p>

			<p class="writing">Exploring sites…creating a work that goes to its viewers</p>

			<p class="writing">Also: Visually, am I conveying the relationship between doubts and defaults through form? Is that the content and then is dispersion the form? Hm. </p>
