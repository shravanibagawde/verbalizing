  <span>When I reach into an empty pocket and feel around, it feels like my hand is trying to make sense of the available space. </span><span>There is an additive quality to removal. </span><span>The making of space is still a kind of production. </span><span>What is the difference between finding a gap and creating a gap? </span><span>(1) In 1973, Mary Miss created a 7 foot by 7 foot sculpture in Oberlin, Ohio. </span><span>It was a rectangular hole in the earth, with a wooden lattice embedded. </span><span>She says, “Unlike a monolith, the work confronts the viewer in a way that is compelling by its absence”. </span><span>(2) “I don’t hear music when I write it. I write in order to hear something I haven’t heard yet” </span><span>(3) Claudia Marina wonders what participatory design may would look like without designers. <span>What do we gain from exclusion?</span> </span><span>(4) Alexander Galloway describes JODI’s work as being assembled from the negative space that exists between discrete web pages. </span><span>(5) One does not learn something new until one unlearns something old, otherwise one is simply adding information rather than rethinking a structure. </span><span>(6) Choosing to maintain or remove outliers from a dataset is a political act. </span><span>Their absences shape and set the stakes for what is and isn’t valued. </span><span>(7) When asked about the temporality of archives, artist Romi Morrison described gaps as gesturing towards an inquiry and a history. </span><span>(8) In 4’33’, Cage writes what has not been and cannot possibly be musically formalized nor technically inscribed. </span><span>What could be more ephemeral, perishable, drastically and fundamentally non-writable than silence?</span>
